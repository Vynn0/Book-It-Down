# Past Date Booking Prevention - Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of past date booking prevention in the Book-It-Down application.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced DateTimeUtils (src/utils/dateUtils.ts)
- Added `isPastDate(date: Date): boolean` - Check if a date is before today (date-only comparison)
- Added `isPastDateTime(date: Date): boolean` - Check if a datetime is before current time
- Added `getStartOfToday(): Date` - Get start of today in Jakarta timezone

### 2. Updated Calendar Component (src/components/ui/Calendar.tsx)
- Added timezone-aware past date validation in `handleDateClick` function
- Added `validRange` property to FullCalendar to disable past dates visually
- Added `dayCellClassNames` to apply gray styling to past dates
- Added CSS styling to make past dates appear disabled and non-clickable
- Added alert message when users try to click past dates
- Enhanced color support for new booking statuses (Completed, Expired)

### 3. Enhanced Booking Validation (src/hooks/useBooking.ts)
- Replaced simple date comparison with timezone-aware `DateTimeUtils.isPastDateTime()`
- Added separate validation for past dates vs past times
- Improved error messages for better user understanding
- Added validation for both date and datetime to prevent edge cases

### 4. Updated BookingModal (src/components/ui/BookingModal.tsx)
- Added past date validation in `checkAvailability()` function
- Added past datetime validation in `handleBooking()` function
- Enhanced error messages to guide users properly
- Added multiple layers of validation to prevent past bookings

### 5. Automatic Status Management
- Enhanced existing booking status management system
- Added support for 'Completed' and 'Expired' status types
- Integrated automatic status checking in booking-related components

## Features Implemented

### Frontend Validation
1. **Calendar Level**: Past dates are visually disabled and non-clickable
2. **Modal Level**: Availability checking prevents past date/time selection
3. **UI Feedback**: Clear error messages when users try to book past dates

### Backend Validation
1. **Hook Level**: Multiple validation layers in useBooking hook
2. **Timezone Aware**: Uses Jakarta timezone for accurate past date detection
3. **Multiple Checks**: Validates both date and datetime separately

### User Experience
1. **Visual Indicators**: Past dates are grayed out in calendar
2. **Helpful Messages**: Clear error messages explain why booking failed
3. **Prevention**: Multiple layers prevent accidental past date bookings

## How It Works

1. **Calendar Display**: Past dates appear grayed out and are non-clickable
2. **Date Click**: Clicking past dates shows an alert and does nothing
3. **Booking Modal**: Past date selection is validated before allowing booking
4. **Server Validation**: Final validation happens in booking hook before API call

## Validation Flow

```
User clicks date → 
Calendar checks if past → 
If past: Show alert, stop → 
If valid: Open modal → 
Modal validates times → 
If valid: Allow booking → 
Hook validates again → 
If valid: Create booking
```

## Error Messages
- "Cannot book rooms for past dates. Please select a current or future date."
- "Cannot book rooms for past times. Please select a current or future time."
- Alert: "Cannot book rooms for past dates. Please select a current or future date."

## Testing
All validation is timezone-aware using Jakarta timezone (UTC+7) and prevents:
- Booking on past dates
- Booking at past times on current date
- Edge cases around timezone boundaries

The system now fully prevents past date bookings through multiple validation layers while providing clear user feedback.
